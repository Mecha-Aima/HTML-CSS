# Web Development Journey

Welcome to my web development repository! 🎉 This repository is a collection of HTML and CSS files, explanatory notes, and past projects I've worked on during my learning journey. My goal is to share these resources to help other beginners in their web development journey and to showcase the general grasp I have on web design.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Here's a breakdown of the contents you'll find in this repository:

### 1. **HTML and CSS Explanatory Files**
   - Detailed HTML and CSS code examples with in-line comments.
   - Beginner-friendly explanations to help you understand the basics of web design.
   - Sample projects that demonstrate the application of HTML and CSS concepts.

### 2. **Notes**
   - Personal notes and summaries on various web development topics.
   - References to useful resources and learning materials.

### 3. **Past Projects**
   - A collection of small projects I've worked on while learning HTML and CSS.
   - Each project is well-documented with a description of its purpose, design choices, and how it was built.

## ⚠️ Heads-Up

Please note that this repository contains **very little JavaScript**. The focus here is primarily on HTML and CSS, as my goal was to build a solid foundation in these technologies. However, I plan to incorporate more JavaScript in future projects as I continue to learn.

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're a beginner, feel free to explore the code and notes. Each file is designed to be as informative as possible, with comments and explanations included throughout. You can clone or download the repository to your local machine and start experimenting with the code.
